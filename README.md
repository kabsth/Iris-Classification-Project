# Iris-Classification-Project
# Iris Classification Project

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using the popular Iris dataset.  
The goal is to predict whether a given flower is Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on its features.

## Dataset Features

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Steps Performed

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize the data
3. Split the data into training and test sets
4. Train a Random Forest Classifier
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Running the Project

Clone the repository and open the notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris-Classification-Project.git
cd Iris-Classification-Project
jupyter notebook Iris_Classification_Model.ipynb
